Quick Install:

(1) execute './configure; make' to compile this program.

(2) sudo and execute 'make install' to install executable
  binaries and resources files.

If some depended libraries are installed in custom directories,
set LDFLAGS and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variables and do
configure.

e.g.
$ export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib/boost_1.44
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/boost_1.44:/usr/local/lib
$ ./configure
...


Generate and update the configure scripts:

(1) edit configure.ac.

(2) execute './autotool.sh' to create/update the configure scripts.
